These are the dot files, of the starship Nicholas.

There's nothing terribly fancy in here for now, just slightly modified
versions of Cygwin's default bashrc, my tmux.conf, and a decent vimrc.
Feel free to borrow anything useful, and get in touch if it breaks!

The included `setup_configs.sh` script is very simple and very fragile,
it attempts to create backups of any existing configs it enocounters,
but do be careful. If you want to set things up manually, make sure
that you append a dot in front of the name of each file, e.g. `bashrc`
becomes `.bashrc`.
